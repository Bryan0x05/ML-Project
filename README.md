# ML-Project
Added branch protections for main. Main requires a pull request to commit to it.

## Guidelines
### Project Options 
* New machine learning algorithm.
* Application of an algorithm to a dataset in a way that havenâ€™t been done before.
* Evaluating some existing algorithms in detail.
* Compare the performance of several algorithms on the same dataset.
### Datasets
Datasets **must be publicly available** and must not involve any restrictions


Only use publicly available datasets from **reputable machine learning related research sources**
*Note*: [Kraggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) has been confirmed to be fine it is likely that [hugginface](https://huggingface.co/) is fine but we may want to confirm.  


The datasets must be unrestricted, meaning it is available for immediate download without any restrictions or use limitations and without any need to request access.
*Note*: Above exceptions have been made.  

**Sources**:
* [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/)
* [UCR Time Series Classification Archive](https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/time_series_data/)
* [CIFAR](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)

## Assignment  
* [Proposal](./Proposal/README.md)
    * 5% of project grade
    * Use the IEEE conference proceedings templates, found here: https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html You also need to list all team member's names and UML emails

## Time Tracking 
We can use a google sheet shared in the discord and occasionally stored here.
